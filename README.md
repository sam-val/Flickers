*(a flicker of a imgage is a when it goes away and comes back again quickly)*

## Ever heard of the [``Flicker Fusion Threshold``][wiki]? Me neither.

 Basically it states that if an image flickers with **``enough speed``** to a certain ***``N``*** flickers per second...
 
## ...the flickers will *``dissapear``*.

It's the mechanism that film projector uses to create the illusion of moving pictures.

But because of the monitor **``refreshing rate``**... 

...I suppose the flickers on monitor doesn't behave the same way as that in real life.
